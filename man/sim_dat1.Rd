\title{Simulate a single dataset based on the response probability(ies), the total
sample size(s), and the interim look schedule(s)}
\usage{
sim_dat1(p, n)
}
\arguments{
\item{p}{vector of length two containing the probability of event in
the standard of care and experimental arm c(p0, p1) for the two-sample case;
integer of event probability for one-sample case}

\item{n}{matrix containing the total number of patients accrued so far at
each interim look in the standard of care (column 1) and experimental
(column 2) arms for two-sample case; vector of sample size accrued so far
at each interim look for one-sample case. The last value should be equal to
the total sample size at the end of the trial.
If only a single look will be done
at the end of the trial, this can be a vector specifying the total sample
size c(N0, N1) for the two-sample case or an integer specifying the total
sample size N for the one-sample case}
}
\value{
Returns a tibble with n0, n1, y0, y1 for the two-sample case and
a tibble with n1 and y1 for the one-sample case
}
\description{
Helper function for calibrate_thresholds() function that
generates a single dataset of n and response count at each look based on the
response probability(ies)
